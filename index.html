                    American cargo carrier Western Global Airlines has sought refuge in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
                    protection. The
                    airline, faced with a staggering debt load of over $450 million, has taken this step to restructure
                    and regain
                    financial stability. The decision to restructure was prompted by declining revenues, a burdensome
                    debt burden,
                    and a lack of transparency as the key concerns. Amidst the financial turbulence, Western Global

                    during its reorganization process. In the meantime, other airlines such as Delta and United continue

                        The severe heatwave over North and Central India in late May — when temperatures neared the 50°
                        Celsius mark
                        in Delhi and Rajasthan — was warmer than past heatwaves and strengthened by human-induced
                        climate change, an
                        analysis by a European Union-funded organisation has said.

                        More than 37 cities in the two regions recorded temperatures above 45° C, leading to
                        heat-related illness
                        warnings, said the analysis by ClimaMeter.

                        The researchers assessed past and present weather conditions such as atmospheric pressure at the
                        surface,
                        temperature and precipitation. They compared low pressure systems — associated with inclement
                        weather such
                        as
                        cyclonic storms — at the end of the 20th century (1979-2001) and in recent decades (2002-2023),
                        when the
                        effects of climate change have become more evident.
                        The scientists found that heatwaves, such as those that hit India, are now almost 1.5° C more
                        intense.
                        Temperatures in parts of Delhi such as Najafgarh, Mungeshpur and Narela were in the range of
                        47-49° C .
